# How to use
- run `manual_movement.py` and the rest of the instructions should be there
- You can either send single hexadecimal code, use your computer's keyboard, or run a script that moves the M3-FS from end to end in small steps
- I also attempted to communicate with the Pixhawk4, though this is a very basic script (the pymavlink_testing.py) that receives the raw longitude and latitude of the specfic drone we connect to. You can use this function to learn about the functions in the pymavlink library, but I would recommend creating new code.
