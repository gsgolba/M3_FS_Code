# How to use
## Manual Control
- The M3_FS_serial directory should have folders for the source code and header code.
- The source folder should have a makefile where `make` should make your executable which you can run with `./manual_control`
- `make clean` will also get rid of the .o files
- cd 
## AutoPilot/Drone GPS
- I tried some attempts to talk with the gps of the drone to the raspberry pi
- An example is seen in the cuart_interface_example folder. However, I did not get too far with this so the code isn't too useful
